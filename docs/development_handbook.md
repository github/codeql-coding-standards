## Scope of work

A _coding standard_ is a set of rules or guidelines which restrict or prohibit the use of certain dangerous or confusing coding patterns or language features. This repository contains CodeQL queries (and supporting processes) which implement a number of different coding standards. The currently supported standards are:

| Standard                                                                                                             | Version | Total rules | Total supportable rules | Status         | Notes                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ----------- | ----------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [AUTOSAR C++](https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/user_upload/standards/adaptive/20-11/AUTOSAR_RS_CPP14Guidelines.pdf) | 20-11   | 397         | 375                     | Implemented    |
| [CERT-C++](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/downloads/secure-coding/assets/sei-cert-cpp-coding-standard-2016-v01.pdf)   | 2016    | 83          | 83                      | Implemented    | AUTOSAR includes a sub-set of rules take from MISRA C++ 2008, which can be purchased for a small fee from [the MISRA website](https://misra.org.uk/shop). |
| [CERT-C](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/downloads/secure-coding/assets/sei-cert-c-coding-standard-2016-v01.pdf)       | 2016    | 120         | 99                      | In development | The implementation excludes rules not part of 2016, but that are added to the [CERT-C wiki](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/)               |
| [MISRA C](https://www.misra.org.uk/product/misra-c2012-third-edition-first-revision/ )                               | 2012    | 172         | 172                     | In development | This includes the [MISRA C:2012 Amendment 2](https://www.misra.org.uk/app/uploads/2021/06/MISRA-C-2012-AMD2.pdf)                                          |


Each coding standard consists of a list of "guidelines", however not all the guidelines in all the standards will be amenable to automated static analysis. The AUTOSAR C++ standard categorizes the guidelines according to enforcement by static analysis tools in section _5.1.3 Rule classification according to enforcement by static analysis_ of the standard. The CERT-C++ standard does not provide such categorization, but frequently has a [documented](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/cplusplus/How+this+Coding+Standard+Is+Organized#HowthisCodingStandardIsOrganized-AutomatedDetection) automated detection section for guidelines that documents tools, including their limitations, that can verify the guidelines in question. We have therefore carefully reviewed each supported standard. For each guidelines that is not categorized as automatic enforceable we have determined,in conjunction with end users, what parts of the guideline can be supported in which capacity with CodeQL.

For some of the rules which are not amenable to static analysis, we may opt to provide a query which aids with "auditing" the rules. For example, AUTOSAR includes a rule (A10-0-1) "Public inheritance shall be used to implement 'is-a' relationship.". This is not directly amenable to static analysis, because it requires external context around the concept being modeled. However, we can provide an "audit" rule which reports all the public and private inheritance relationships in the program, so they can be manually verified.

For each rule which will be implemented with a query we have assigned a "rule package". Rule packages represent sets of rules, possibly across standards, that will be implemented together. Examples of rule packages include "Exceptions", "Naming", "Pointers" and so forth. By implementing queries for related rules together, we intend to maximize the amount of code shared between queries, and to ensure query developers can gain a deep understanding of that specific topic.

The canonical list of rules, with implementation categorization and assigned rule packages, are stored in this repository in the `rules.csv` file.

### Software tool qualification under ISO 26262

A common use case for the coding standards specified above is to to help in the certification process for safety critical or low fault tolerance systems. For these purposes the "CodeQL Coding Standards" pack is intended to be qualified as a "software tool" under "Part 8: Supporting processes" of ISO 26262 ("Road vehicles - Functional Safety"). For more details, see [iso_26262_tool_qualification.md](iso_26262_tool_qualification.md).

To support the functional safety use case, the scope of work for this project also includes:

 - _Analysis reporting_ - producing reports for functional safety purposes that summarize the findings and highlight any issues during analysis that could compromise the integrity of those findings.
 - _Deviations_ - a process for suppressing valid results, and maintaining metadata

The requirements for these additional components are taken from the [MISRA Compliance 2020](https://www.misra.org.uk/app/uploads/2021/06/MISRA-Compliance-2020.pdf) document. Further details of these use cases can be found in the [user manual](user_manual.md).

## Rule development process

### Overview

 * For each selected rule we will write one or more CodeQL queries that implement the rule (see section _Splitting a rule into multiple queries_).
 * Queries will be grouped into CodeQL packs, according to the coding standard the rule comes from.
 * To ensure consistency and increase the speed of development, we generate outline query files from the `rules.csv` specification file.
 * Where a rule is duplicated across different standards, we will still create separate queries for each standard, but the implementation may be shared between the standards. This allows each version to provide different metadata, and to be enabled/disabled individually.
 
### Architecture

For each supported coding standard we will provide:
 1. A CodeQL query pack containing the queries that implement the designated rules.
 2. A CodeQL query pack containing the unit tests ("qltests") for each of the queries.

These packs will be organized by supported language.
The current supported languages are:
- C++14 standardized by [ISO/IEC 14882:2014](https://www.iso.org/standard/64029.html) located in the directory `cpp`.
- C90 standardized by [ISO/IEC 9899:1990](https://www.iso.org/standard/17782.html), [C99] standardized by [ISO/IEC 9899:1999](https://www.iso.org/standard/29237.html), and C11 standardized by [ISO/IEC 9899:2011](https://www.iso.org/standard/57853.html). All are located in the directory `c`.

For each language, we will also include:
 1. A CodeQL query pack containing "common" libraries, which provide support.
 2. A CodeQL query pack containing tests for the "common" libraries.

The standards packs will depend on the "common" pack for the given language. This will allow the different standards to share implementation libraries.

In the repository, this will be organized as follows:
```
<lang>/
  <standard>/
    src/
      rules/
        <rule_id>/
          <rule-short-name>.ql
          <rule-short-name>.md
      codeql-suites/
        <standard>-default.qls
        ...
      qlpack.yml
    test/
      rules/
        <rule_id>/
          test.cpp
          ...
          <rule-short-name>.expected
          <rule-short-name>.qlref
      qlpack.yml
  common/
    src/
      codingstandards/
        cpp/
          ...
      qlpack.yml
    test/
      ...
      qlpack.yml
```

### Splitting a rule into multiple queries

A coding standard rule can be implemented by multiple CodeQL queries.
The decision to split a rule into multiple queries should be driven by the following guidelines:

1. A split of a rule in a query simplifies the implementation of each individual query. Indicators are:
   - The number of cases with CodeQL classes that cannot be further generalized because they don't have a common ancestor CodeQL class or have conceptually different representations such as local and global declarations.
   - Multiple language constructs that must be considered such as template vs non-template classes/functions.
2. A corner case of a rule that is responsible for a significant number of alerts in projects not build with that case in mind. A separate query enables a sub-rule deviation.
   - An example is the AUTOSAR guideline `A2-3-1` that prohibits the use of characters outside the basic source character set defined in `[lex.charset]`. Having a separate rule for comments enables a deviation on violations in just comments and keeps violations detected in string literals or identifiers.

### Generation of query templates from rule specifications

In order to speed up rule development and ensure implementation consistency we have created a series of scripts that generate templated rule files based on the `rules.csv` rule specification file. This generation process works on a per-rule package basis, and is driven by the creation of a "rule package description file", describing the mapping from rules to queries which will implement those rules.

For this, there is a three step process:
 1. Generate a rule package description file for a given rule package.
 2. Review each entry in the rule package description file, updating the names and properties of the queries that will be written to implement these rules.
 3. Generate rule files from the rule package description file for a given rule package.

After these scripts have been run each query specified in the rule package description file will have:

- query files,
- query help files,
- empty query test files, and
- query test reference files generated in per-rule directories within each coding standard.

These files will be ready for query implementation.

#### Step 0: Prepare the Python environment

The `scripts` directory contains the pip package specification file `requirements.txt` that contains the dependencies our generation scripts rely upon.

The dependencies can be installed as follows:

```bash
pip3.9 install -r scripts/requirements.txt
```

It is advisable to use a Python virtual environment which needs to be created and activated before installing the dependencies. This can be done as follows:

```bash
python3.9 -mvenv scripts/.venv
. scripts/.venv/bin/activate
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
```

#### Step 1: Generate rule package description file

To generate the rule package description file, run the following script from the root of the repository:

```
python3.9 scripts/generate_rules/generate_package_description.py <rule_package_name>
```

This will produce a `.json` file in the `rule_packages` directory with the name of the rule package (e.g. `rule_packages/Literals.json`).

#### Step 2: Review and update the rule package description file

The rule package description file produced in previous step is a `json` file which has the following structure:
 
 * A rule package object, with properties for each coding standard.
 * A coding standard object, with properties for each implemented rule.
 * A rule object, with:
   * A `properties` property specifying some key-value pairs describing properties of the rule.
   * A `title`s property specifying the rule title (also known as the rule "headline").
   * A `queries` property, specifying an array of query objects
 * A query object, with:
   * A `description` property, which will be used to populate the `@description` query metadata property value for this query.
   * A `kind` property, which will be used to populate the `@kind` query metadata property value for this query.
   * A `name` property, which will be used to populate the `@name` query metadata property value for this query.
   * A `precision` property, which will be used to populate the `@precision` query metadata property value for this query.
   * A `severity` property, which will be used to populate the `@severity` query metadata property value for this query.
   * A `short_name` property, which will be used in the filenames for each file generated for this query, most notable as the name of the generated `.ql` query file, as well as the query id.
   * A `tags` property, which will be used to populate the `@tags` query metadata property value for this query.

For example, this is the first part of the `Exceptions2.json` package file:
```json
{
  "AUTOSAR": {
    "A15-1-1": {
      "properties": {
        "allocated-target": [
          "implementation"
        ],
        "enforcement": "automated",
        "obligation": "advisory"
      },
      "queries": [
        {
          "description": "Throwing types which are not derived from std::exception can lead to developer confusion.",
          "kind": "problem",
          "name": "Only instances of types derived from std::exception should be thrown",
          "precision": "very-high",
          "severity": "recommendation",
          "short_name": "OnlyThrowStdExceptionDerivedTypes",
          "tags": [
            "maintainability"
          ]
        }
      ],
      "title": "Only instances of types derived from std::exception should be thrown."
    }
```

The `generate_package_description.py` script generates a rule package description file which has a single query per-rule and each query is described by a set of properties.
The properties of a query include the [documented](https://codeql.github.com/docs/writing-codeql-queries/metadata-for-codeql-queries/#metadata-properties) metadata properties of a CodeQL query and a name used, defined by the `short_name` property, to generate the required query files.
The query metadata instructs the CodeQL how to handle the query and display its results. It also provides the users with information about what the query results mean.

The `generate_package_description.py` script provides a "best-effort" approach to setting each of the properties. For that reason, the rule package description file must be reviewed and updated. For each rule:

 - Review the rule text in the relevant standard, and determine the number of queries
 -  For each `query` object review and update the following properties:
    - `description` - **_must not be empty and end with a full stop_** - will be blank, unless the rule headline was too long to fit in the `name` property, in which case it will contain the rule headline. If the `description` is blank, fill it in explaining _why_ this could be a problem by explaining the consequences (see the CodeQL [metadata descriptions](https://github.com/github/codeql/blob/main/docs/query-metadata-style-guide.md#query-descriptions-description) documentation for more details).
    - `kind` - pre-populated to `problem`. Modify to `path-problem` if this query is likely to use path explanations - for example, to explain data flow path.
    - `name` - will be pre-populated the first 100 characters of the rule headline text, truncated at a sensible point. This should be a single sentence, and **_must not end in a full stop_**.
    - `precision` - pre-populated based on a "difficulty" column present in the `rules.csv`. Set according to the definition specified in the CodeQL [metadata properties](https://codeql.github.com/docs/writing-codeql-queries/metadata-for-codeql-queries/#metadata-properties) documentation.
    - `severity` - will be pre-populated to `error`, but should be adjusted based on the query. The criteria is that if the query does report a true positive
      - `error` - if the reported issue is either directly a security vulnerability, or directly causes a bug or crash in the program.
      - `warning` - if the reported issue is not an error, but could indirectly lead to a security vulnerability or a bug or crash in the program.
      - `recommendation` - if the reported issue is primarily a stylistic or maintainability issue.
    - `short_name` - must be a PascalCase string without spaces, which will be used for the name of the query file and to generate a query id. Pre-populated heuristically from from the rule headline text. Make adjustments as appropriate:
      - The short name must not exceed 50 characters.
      - Consider whether the query can be described more succinctly. For example `OnlyInstancesOfTypesDerivedFromExceptionShouldBeThrown` can be summarized more clearly as `OnlyThrowStdExceptionDerivedTypes`.
    - `tags` - Apply at least one tag from the possible values listed below. If you want to use a query that is not listed a new tag can be added through a PR that modifies the possible tag values in the `query` sub-schema located in `schemas/rule-package.schema.json` and updates the list of possible values described below.
      - `correctness` - if the query identifies incorrect program behavior.
      - `security` - if the query identifies a potential security vulnerability.
      - `readability` - if the query identifies an issue which makes the code harder to read.
      - `maintainability` - if the query identifies an issue which makes the code harder to maintain.
      - `performance` - if the query identifies an issue which has a negative impact on the performance of the code.
      - `concurrency` - if the query identifies a concurrency issue.
  -  Validate the rule package description file using the `validate-rule-package.py` script that validates the rule package descriptions against the schema `rule-package.schema.json` located in the `schemas` directory.
     -  `python3 scripts/validate-rule-package.py <rule_package_name>`

#### Step 3: 

Ensure that the repository [codeql-coding-standards-help](https://github.com/github/codeql-coding-standards-help) cloned as a sibling of the [codeql-coding-standards](https://github.com/github/codeql-coding-standards) repository switched to a branch that matches the branch your are working on.

To generate the rule package files, run the following script from the root of the repository:

```
python3.9 scripts/generate_rules/generate_package_files.py <rule_package_name>
```

If the repository [codeql-coding-standards-help](https://github.com/github/codeql-coding-standards-help) is not cloned as a sibling, then run the script as follows:

```
python3.9 scripts/generate_rules/generate_package_files.py  --external-help-dir <codeql_coding_standards_help_path> <rule_package_name>
```

After running this script, the following files will be generated in the `<lang>/<standard>/src/rules/<rule-id>/` directory:
 - A `<query.short_name>.ql` query file with the query metadata pre-populated, and the standard imports included.
 - A `<query.short_name>.md` query help file with some boilerplate text describing the purpose of the query.

For the standards AUTOSAR and MISRA the help files will generated in the `<lang>/<standard>/src/rules/<rule-id>` directory of the cloned [codeql-coding-standards-help](https://github.com/github/codeql-coding-standards-help) repository if available, otherwise the help file generation is skipped.

In addition, the following files will be generated in the `<lang>/<standard>/test/rules/<rule-id>/` directory:
 - An empty `test.cpp` or `test.c` file.
 - A `<query.short_name>.qlref` file, which refers to the generated query file.
 - A `<query.short_name>.expected` file, which contains some boiler plate text. This ensures that when qltest is run, it will not succeed, but it will allow the "Compare results" option in the CodeQL VS Code extension (which is only usually available with an `.expected` results file).

The script can be safely re-run, except in a few notable cases listed below. Re-running the script has the following effect:
 - Overwrites`<query.short_name>.qlref` file.
 - Updates the autogenerated sections of the `<query.short_name>.md` file.
 - Touches the `test.cpp`, `test.c`, and `<query.short_name>.expected` files, to ensure they exist on disk, but does not modify them if they exist.
 - Updates the `<query.short_name>.ql` query by overwriting the query metadata block only. The QL portion of the file is left untouched.

The notable exceptions are:
 - If a `query` object is deleted from the rule package description file, it will not be deleted on disk.
 - If a `query` object has the `short_name` property modified in the rule package description file, query files will be created under the new name, but the query files for the old name will not be deleted.

### Updating the query from the rule specification

Updates to the rule specification require an update of the generated queries files.
As described in _step 3_ of the section _Generation of query templates from rule specifications_ the script `scripts/generate_rules/generate_package_files.py` can be safely re-run with the documented exceptions.

Each property of a query in the rule specification can be changed and the generated query files can be updated by rerunning the script `scripts/generate_rules/generate_package_files.py` with exception of the property `query.shortname`. Updating the `query.shortname` property is discussed in the next section.

#### Updating the query shortname

Changing the `query.shortname` property requires a manual update process with the following steps.

1. Determine the query who's `query.shortname` property needs to be updated.
2. Change the `query.shortname` value and generate the query files as described in _step 3_ of the section _Generation of query templates from rule specifications_.
3. Migrate the query definition (excluding the query meta-data) from the previous query file to the new query file identified with the updated shortname.
4. Migrate the relevant sections from query help file from the previous query help file to the new help query file identified with the updated shortname.
5. Migrate the test case expected file identified by old `<query.shortname>.expected` to the update `<query.shortname>.expected` name.
6. Validate that the new test case passes by following the procedure described in the section _Running unit tests_.
7. Remove the following files with `git rm <file>` where `query.shortname` reflects the old shortname in the directory `<lang>/<standard>/src/rules/<rule-id>/`:
     - `<query.short_name>.ql`
     - `<query.short_name>.md`

### Query style guide

The following list describes the required style guides for a query that **must** be validated during the code-review process described in section _Code review and automated checks_.

A query **must** include:
 - A use of the `isExcluded` predicate on the element reported as the primary location. This predicate ensures that we have a central mechanism for excluding results. This predicate may also be used on other elements relevant to the alert, but only if a suppression on that element should also cause alerts on the current element to be suppressed.
 - A well formatted alert message:
   - The message should be a complete standalone sentence, with punctuation and a full stop.
   - The message should refer to this particular instance of the problem, rather than repeating the generic rule. e.g. "Call to banned function x." instead of "Do not use function x."
   - Code elements should be placed in 'single quotes', unless they are formatted as links.
   - Avoid value judgments such as "dubious" and "suspicious", and focus on factual statements about the problem.
   - If possible, avoid constant alert messages. Either add placeholders and links (using $@), or concatenate element names to the alert message. Non-constant messages make it easier to find particular results, and links to other program elements can help provide additional context to help a developer understand the results. Examples:
     - Instead of `Call to banned function.` prefer `Call to banned function foobar.`.
     - Instead of `Return value from call is unused.` prefer `Return value from call to function [x] is unused.`, where `[x]` is a link to the function itself.
   - Do not try to explain the solution in the message; instead that should be provided in the help for the query.

All public predicates, classes, modules and files should be documented with QLDoc. All QLDoc should follow the [QLDoc style guide](https://github.com/github/codeql/blob/main/docs/qldoc-style-guide.md).

### Unit testing

Every query which implements a rule **must** include:
-  One or more unit tests.
-  One or more unit tests for every non-trivial library.
-  For each unit test both "compliant" and "non-compliant" test cases, and should exercise each different logical condition uniquely provided in the query, where possible within the testing framework. The scope of each test should be those conditions specific to this query. In particular, functionality provided by the CodeQL Standard Library for C++ does not need to be tested.

#### Running unit tests

During query development in VS Code, the unit tests can be run using the [testing features](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-for-visual-studio-code/testing-codeql-queries-in-visual-studio-code/) in the CodeQL extension.

Unit tests can also be run on the command line using the CodeQL CLI. With an appropriate CodeQL CLI (as specified in the `supported_codeql_configs.json` at the root of the repository), you can run the following from the root of the repository:
```
codeql test run --show-extractor-output --search-path . path/to/test/directory
```

* `--show-extractor-output` - this shows the output from the extractor. It is most useful when the test fails because the file is not valid C++, where the extractor output will include the compilation failure. This is not shown in VS Code.
* `--search-path .` - this allows the CodeQL CLI to discover all the QL packs within our repository.
* `path/to/test/directory` - this can be a qlref file (like `cpp/autosar/test/rules/A15-2-2/`), a rule directory (`cpp/autosar/test/rules/A15-2-2/`) or a test qlpack (`cpp/autosar/test/`).

For more details on running unit tests with the CodeQL CLI see the [Testing custom queries](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-cli/testing-custom-queries/) help topic.

#### Style guide

The C++ test cases **must** be formatted with `clang_format`.

 - Test functions should be called `test_<test_case>`, where `<test_case>` is a brief description of this test case.

If possible, use meaningful names for elements in test cases. Where arbitrary names are required, you may use the following:

 - Local variables should be named `l<i>`, with i incremented for each new variable.
 - Global variables should be named `g<i>`, with i incremented for each new variable.
 - Functions should be named `f<i>`, with i incremented for each new variable.
 - Member variables should be named `m<i>`, with i incremented for each new variable.

Test cases **must** be annotated with a line-ending comment in this format:
```
(COMPLIANT(\[FALSE_POSITIVE\])?|NON_COMPLIANT(\[FALSE_NEGATIVE\])?)( - .*)?
```
Where:
 - `COMPLIANT` is added if the line represents a "compliant" test case
   - The annotation `[FALSE_POSITIVE]` is added if the query currently reports this result.
 - `NON_COMPLIANT` is chosen if the line represents a non-compliant test case
   - The annotation `[FALSE_NEGATIVE]` is added if the query currently does not report this result.

For example:
```
  "\s";         // NON_COMPLIANT[FALSE_NEGATIVE]
  "\n";         // COMPLIANT
  "\U00000024"; // COMPLIANT[FALSE_POSITIVE]
```

#### Copying test code

Like the `github/codeql` repository, the contents of our test files should not be copied from external sources (third-party code, personal projects, standard libraries). The only exceptions to this rule are the copying of declarations from:
 - [ISO/IEC Programming languages - C](https://www.iso.org/standard/74528.html) (all versions)
 - [ISO/IEC Programming languages - C++](https://www.iso.org/standard/68564.html) (all versions)
 - Code from existing queries and tests in the `github/codeql` repository.
 - Code from existing queries and tests in this repository.
 - Code in the public domain

This policy is based on the public policy for `github/codeql` as specified at [github/codeql: C++ Unit Tests - Copying code](https://github.com/github/codeql/blob/main/cpp/ql/test/README.md#copying-code).

#### Dependencies on the C++/C Standard Library

Many of the C++/C coding standards refer to use or misuse of APIs defined in the C++/C Standard Library. However, CodeQL Unit Tests, are implemented to be agnostic to the environment in which they run. This means they cannot depend on the system provided standard library.

To write unit tests that refer to APIs in the standard library, we therefore need to provide "stubs" for each API we intend to call as part of a test.

We have therefore implemented a partial "stub" standard library in the `cpp/common/test/includes/standard-library` and `c/common/test/includes/standard-library` directories. These directories contains files which mimic the C++/C Standard Library.

### Code review and automated checks

Each proposed changed to `main` or a release branch is required to go through a code review process. This involves:

 - A review and explicit approval by at least one other team member with "Write" access to the repository.
 - Running automated checks that validate and verify the change and ensuring they pass.

This is implemented by requiring that proposed changes are submitted as pull requests to the GitHub repository hosting the queries, and is enforced by enabling GitHub [branch protection](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches) policies on the `main` and the release branches.

An approving review and a "passing" state from every "Required" automated check is required before the Pull Request is merged. In exceptional circumstances this process may be overridden by an "Administrator" on the repository with approval from one of the Safety Managers. In the case of such an override the "Administrator" must document on the pull request the reasons for overriding, including a short justification of why doing so does not negatively impact the use of the queries in a safety critical context.

#### Automated checks

The following automated checks are run on every push and pull request to `main` and to the release branches:

 * Running the CodeQL Coding Standard unit tests against supported CodeQL CLIs and CodeQL Standard Libraries for C++.
 * Validating that release artifacts can be created for that branch.
 * Validating style rules for queries and test files.
 * Confirming that the query help files are valid.

These automated checks should pass before the pull request is merged.

#### Code review checklist

A [pull request template](https://github.com/github/codeql-coding-standards/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md) is provided which includes a "code review checklist". The checklist provides boxes for both the "Author" and the "Reviewer", both of which must be completed before the pull request can be merged.

For pull requests that pre-date the pull request template checklist and modify or add queries, the pull request body must be retrospectively updated with the pull request template checklist, and both the "Author" and "Reviewer" must review the items and attest that they were satisfied. If they were not, follow up pull requests must be submitted to address the outstanding issues, and only after they have been merged can the checklist be checked. This process must happen before the 1.0.0 release can occur.

#### Change notes

For proposed changes that modify the released artifacts an entry must be included in the release notes.

For proposed changes which only add new queries or support for new rules, this process is fully automated, by reviewing differences in rule package metadata files between releases.

For proposed changes which change:
 - The structure or layout of the release artifacts.
 - The evaluation performance (memory, execution time) of an existing query.
 - The results of an existing query.

A _change note_ must be added to the `change_notes` directory. The format of the change notes is to create a file with a name matching the following pattern:
```
YYYY-MM-DD-short-name-for-issue.md
```
For example `2021-06-29-remove-incompatibility-codeql-cli-2.5.6.md`.

The contents of the file should be a markdown list (using `-`) with a user facing message specifying the nature of the change. If the changes relate to specific queries, then the top-level entry should specify the rule and query, and should provide a nested list of the changes. For example:
```
 - `A12-8-6` - `CopyAndMoveNotDeclaredProtected.ql`:
   - Fixed issue #174 - a result is now only reported when the declaring class is either used as a base class in the database, or where the class is abstract.
   - Fixed a bug where exclusions did not apply to invalid assignment operators.
   - Changed the location of the alert to always report the function declaration entry in the class body, rather than the definition location which may be outside the class.
   - Updated the alert message to specify the kind of member function, the name of the declaring type and to clarify it is a base class.
```

### External dependencies

There are two external dependencies required for running the coding standards queries:
 1. The CodeQL CLI, the command line tool for building CodeQL databases and running queries over those databases.
 2. The CodeQL Standard Library

For the purpose of this repository, and any tool qualification, we consider these external dependencies to be "black boxes" which require verification when upgrading.

To (a) clearly specify the supported versions of these external dependencies and to (b) enable automation around them, the repository contains a `supported_codeql_configs.json` which lists the sets of supported configurations. There are four fields:

 * `codeql_cli` - this is the plain version number of the supported CodeQL CLI, e.g. `2.6.3`.
 * `codeql_standard_library` - this is the name of a tag on the `github.com/github/codeql` repository. The tag should be compatible with the CodeQL CLI given above. For an enterprise release compatible with LGTM an `lgtm/v<version-number>` should be chosen. For CodeQL CLI releases which are not tied to an enterprise release we would typically use `codeql-cli/v<version-number>`, although any tag which is compatible is allowed.
 * `codeql_cli_bundle` - (optional) - if present, describes the CodeQL CLI bundle version that is compatible. The bundle should include precisely the CodeQL CLI version and CodeQL Standard Library versions specified in the two mandatory fields.
 * `ghes` - (optional) - if present describes the GitHub Enterprise Server release whose integrated copy of the CodeQL Action points to the CodeQL CLI bundle specified in the `codeql_cli_bundle` field.

#### Upgrading external dependencies

To upgrade the CodeQL external dependencies:

 1. Determine appropriate versions of the CodeQL CLI and `github/codeql` repository, according to the release schedule and customer demands.
 2. Determine if there is a compatible CodeQL CLI bundle version by looking at the releases specified at https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases. The bundle always includes the standard library at the version specified by the `codeql-cli/v<version-number>` tag in the `github/codeql` repository.
 3. If you find a compatible CodeQL CLI bundle, determine whether that bundle was released in a GitHub Enterprise server release, by inspecting the `defaults.json` file at https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/lib/defaults.json#L2 for the CodeQL Action submitted with
 4. Populated the `supported_codeql_configs.json` file with the given values, ensuring to delete the optional fields if they are not populated.
 5. Update the `codeql_modules/codeql` submodule pointer to the `codeql_standard_library` tag identified.
 6. Submit a Pull Request to the `github/codeql-coding-standards` repository with the title `Upgrade `github/codeql` dependency to <insert codeql_standard_library value>`. Use this template for the description, filling :
  ```
  This PR updates the `supported_codeql_configs.json` file to target:

  - CodeQL CLI <codeql_cli>
  - CodeQL Standard Library <codeql_standard_library>
  - GHES <ghes>
  - CodeQL CLI Bundle <date_of_bundle>

  <EITHER:This should match the versions of CodeQL deployed with LGTM <version> and GitHub Enterprise Server <ghes>>
  <OR: This does not match any released version of LGTM or GitHub Enterprise Server.>

  ## CodeQL dependency upgrade checklist:

  - [ ] Reformat our CodeQL using the latest version (if required)
  - [ ] Identify any CodeQL compiler warnings and errors, and update queries as required.
  - [ ] Validate that the `github/codeql` test cases succeed.
  - [ ] Address any CodeQL test failures in the `github/codeql-coding-standards` repository.
  - [ ] Validate performance vs pre-upgrade
  ```
 7. Follow the dependency upgrade checklist, confirming each step. The `.github/workflows/standard_library_upgrade_tests.yml` will trigger automation for running the `github/codeql` unit tests with the appropriate CLI version.
 8. Once all the automate tests have passed, and the checklist is complete, the PR can be merged.
 9. An internal notification should be shared with the development team.

### Release process

#### Version Numbering 

Version numbers follow semantic versioning and adhere to the following guidelines specific to Coding Standards. 

Given the version `<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>`:

1. If the release only fixes bugs, increment the `PATCH` number only.
2. If a release contains additional queries, increment the `MINOR` version number and set the `PATCH` number to 0. Note this may also contain fixes in addition to new queries. 
3. Otherwise, if the release contains breaking changes such as removing queries, increment the `MAJOR` version number and set `MINOR` and `PATCH` to zero.

#### Release management

We use the "Releases" feature in GitHub to manage and track our releases. This provides traceability back to the specific commit in the repository that was released, a storage location for release artifacts and a location to report the release notes associated with the release.

To simplify the process of generating the release information, the repository contains a number of scripts and Action workflows:

 - [`generate_release_notes.py`](../scripts/release/generate_release_notes.py) - a script for generating release notes based on the contents of the repository in comparison to the previous release.
 - [`create_draft_release.sh`](../scripts/release/create_draft_release.sh) - a script for creating a release by:
    1. Downloading the appropriate artifacts
    2. Generating the release notes by calling `generate_release_notes.py` with appropriate parameters
    3. Generating the list of supported rules 
    4. Creating a draft release on GitHub containing the artifacts from the previous steps
    5. Triggering integration testing on the new release.
 - [`create-draft-release.yml`](../.github/workflows/create-draft-release.yml) - a GitHub Actions workflow for running the `create_draft_release.sh` on demand within the CI/CD environment.

#### Branching workflow

Each new major or minor release should have a dedicated release branch, with the name `rc/<major>.<minor>`. A new patch version should re-use the existing release branch for the release that is being patched.
Ensure that the same release branch is created in the [codeql-coding-standards-help](https://github.com/github/codeql-coding-standards-help) repository.

#### Artifact creation

There is an automated CI/CD job ([Code Scanning Query Pack Generation](../.github/workflows/code-scanning-pack-gen.yml)) provided that generates the following release artifacts for Coding Standards:

 - LGTM query pack - generates a query pack that can be deployed to LGTM.
 - Code Scanning query pack - generates a zipped folder that can be used with the CodeQL CLI directly, or with GitHub Advanced Security.

**Use of LGTM and GitHub Advanced Security is not in scope for ISO 26262 tool qualification. See [user_manual.md#github-advanced-security-and-lgtm](user_manual.md#github-advanced-security-and-lgtm) for more information**.

These run on every push to `main` and `rc/*`, and on every pull request, and are releasable without modification, assuming all other status checks succeed on the same commit.

#### Creating a release

To create a new release:
 1. Create an internal "release checklist" issue.
 2. Determine the appropriate release version. Version numbers are generated
    according to the guidelines in the section "Version Numbering."
 3. If a new `MAJOR` version is necessary, create a new `rc/<MAJOR>.0` branch off of `main`. Otherwise, reuse the existing `rc` branch and merge work from `main` into the `rc` branch you have selected.
 4. Ensure the same `rc` branch exists in the [codeql-coding-standards-help](https://github.com/github/codeql-coding-standards-help) repository. This branch will be used to include external help files.
 5. Submit a PR to update the `qlpack.yml` version numbers on the `main` branch to the next anticipated release.
 6. Submit a PR to update the `qlpack.yml` version numbers on the release branch to the new version.
 7. Trigger a [workflow dispatch event](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow) for the [Create draft release](../.github/workflows/create-draft-release.yml) workflow, specifying the release branch. The output of this workflow should report a link to the draft release and a link to the integration testing workflow triggered for this release.
    - In the event the workflow is unusable, the [`create_draft_release.sh`](../scripts/release/create_draft_release.sh) script can be run directly on a local machine.
 8. Run the following workflows with the new version number, e.g., `v2.0.0`:
    - [Test Linux/x86_64](https://github.com/github/codeql-coding-standards-release-engineering/actions/workflows/test-release-performance-linux-x86_64.yml)   
    - [Test Windows/x86_64](https://github.com/github/codeql-coding-standards-release-engineering/actions/workflows/test-release-performance-windows-x86_64.yml)
    - [Regenerate Performance Views](https://github.com/github/codeql-coding-standards-release-engineering/actions/workflows/regenerate-performance-views.yml)
 9. Confirm the integration testing workflow completes successfully, and that the execution time is comparable to previous releases, taking into account that the execution time is expected to increase proportionally as more queries are added for each release. Results may be viewed on the release engineering repo: https://github.com/github/codeql-coding-standards-release-engineering
 10. For release 1.0.0 and above, the integration testing results must be verified. For each "integration testing codebase":
    - Download the SARIF result file
    - Compare the results against the previously computed set of results for that integration testing codebase, and, for any new or changed results, spot check to confirm validity.
    - For false positives and false negatives identified during this process issues should be opened on this repository to track the problems identified.
    - For each issue opened, assess whether they are "significant" i.e. whether they are likely to cause problems in practice with customers. If so, consider Step 7. failed.
 11. If the release fails steps 7. or 8. (if applicable), retain the draft release, and rename it to `vminor.major.patch-rc<count>`. Address the release blocking issues on the `rc/<major>.<minor>` branch, and restart the release process at Step 7.
 12. If steps 7. and 8. (if applicable) succeeded, then the release can be marked as "published".
 13. Release artifacts can now be distributed to customers.
 14. Create an internal "release retrospective" issue, and document any pain points or other issues.
 15. Create a PR that merges the release candidate branch into `main`.

## False Positive Triage Rubric

When triaging issues in Coding Standards, please refer to the following rubric for making classifications. 

**Impact**

| Level         | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Impact-High   | Issue occurs in one or more production code bases with high frequency. Issue is considered to be disruptive to customer. **Issues determined to be Impact-High at the end of a triage session should be assigned with 24 hours.** |
| Impact-Medium | Issue occurs in production code bases with relatively low to moderate frequency. Issue may or may not be considered disruptive to customer.                                                                                       |
| Impact-Low    | Issue may not occur in production code bases and may require hand crafted examples to surface. If the issue occurs in production code bases it occurs either infrequently or impacts only a few codebases.                        |

**Difficulty**

| Level                          | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Difficulty-High                | High difficulty fixes are issues that take the most time. Probable classes of issues include: A) Fixes to the issue are not isolated (i.e., issue may impact other queries due to changes required to library files).  B) Issue involves workarounds for missing syntax that may be brittle C) Issue is a workaround for limitations in the CodeQL standard libraries D) Issue is a performance issue. |
| Difficulty-Medium              | Medium difficulty fixes are fixes that do not meet the criteria of High or low Difficulty fixes and involve substantial isolated work to a query on dataflow, taint tracking, or control flow issues. Expanding the set of sources for a query, for example, would be considered a medium difficulty query.                                                                                            |
| Difficulty-Low                 | Low difficulty fixes are of the lowest complexity and involve non-semantic changes to queries such as changing query metadata, updating error messages, and changes to isolated queries requiring little or no changes to the core query. Examples of allowed changes are adding special cases to an abstract class or supporting different forms previously not considered by the query.              |
| Difficulty-Needs-Investigation | Difficulty is not known. Issue needs further investigation beyond the triage session to establish a rating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Cookbook

The following sections have examples for some common procedures.

### Using the cli to examine and run unit tests, and creating the .expected file from a query

```sh
# local clone of git@github.com:github/codeql-coding-standards.git
cd ~/local/codeql-coding-standards

# MUST use the codeql cli and library versions listed in
# supported_codeql_configs.json (2.3.4).

# Get it from https://github.com/github/codeql-cli-binaries/releases; for the mac,
# https://github.com/github/codeql-cli-binaries/releases/download/v2.3.4/codeql-osx64.zip.
# Extract and name the directory, then add it to the PATH:
export PATH="$HOME/local/vmsync/codeql234:$PATH"

# check it:
codeql --version

# Generally, you have to use the required ql library version.  Note the ql/ tree
# is parallel to codeql234.
# 
# For the codeql-coding-standards/ project, the codeql_modules/codeql submodule
# contains the required ql library version.
# cd $HOME/local/vmsync/ql
# git checkout v1.26.0

# List some project's data
cd ~/local/codeql-coding-standards
ls cpp/cert/test/rules/EXP52-CPP/*.qlref

# The link to the query file is in 
cat cpp/cert/test/rules/EXP52-CPP/DoNotRelyOnSideEffectsInDeclTypeOperand.qlref
# The expected output is in
cat cpp/cert/test/rules/EXP52-CPP/DoNotRelyOnSideEffectsInDeclTypeOperand.expected 

# The referenced query file
ls cpp/cert/src/$(cat cpp/cert/test/rules/EXP52-CPP/DoNotRelyOnSideEffectsInDeclTypeOperand.qlref)

# Run a test.  See
# https://github.com/github/codeql-coding-standards/blob/main/development_handbook.md#unit-testing
codeql test run --show-extractor-output \
       --search-path . \
       cpp/cert/test/rules/EXP52-CPP/DoNotRelyOnSideEffectsInDeclTypeOperand.qlref 

# Get a db error?  Applying  the recommended fix 
#     codeql database upgrade cpp/cert/test/rules/EXP52-CPP/EXP52-CPP.testproj
# won't work.

# Instead use the CodeQL CLI setup specified in supported_codeql_configs.json

# My output:

# Compiling queries in /Users/hohn/local/codeql-coding-standards/cpp/cert/test/rules/EXP52-CPP.
# Executing tests in /Users/hohn/local/codeql-coding-standards/cpp/cert/test/rules/EXP52-CPP.
# [1/1 comp 32.7s eval 890ms] PASSED /Users/hohn/local/codeql-coding-standards/cpp/cert/test/rules/EXP52-CPP/DoNotRelyOnSideEffectsInDeclTypeOperand.qlref
# All 1 tests passed.

# If the expected output is not yet present, it is printed as a diff:
mv cpp/cert/test/rules/EXP52-CPP/DoNotRelyOnSideEffectsInDeclTypeOperand.expected foo
codeql test run --show-extractor-output --search-path .                         \
       cpp/cert/test/rules/EXP52-CPP/DoNotRelyOnSideEffectsInDeclTypeOperand.qlref

# The actual output can be accepted via codeql test accept (which moves some files):
codeql test accept \
       cpp/cert/test/rules/EXP52-CPP/DoNotRelyOnSideEffectsInDeclTypeOperand.qlref

### Troubleshooting: Unrecoverable mismatch between extractor and library dbschemes

The following error could be indicative of the Git submodule _codeql-coding-standards/github_modules_ being out-of-date:

>Could not upgrade the dataset in /path/to/codeql-coding-standards/cpp/autosar/test/rules/...: Unrecoverable mismatch between extractor and library dbschemes.

To resolve the problem, update the submodule by executing `git submodule update`.
