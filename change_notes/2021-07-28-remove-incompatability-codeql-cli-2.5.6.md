- Removed query library incompatibility with CodeQL Standard Library codeql-cli/v2.5.6 and later. A QL class called `FixedWidthIntegralType` was added to both the CodeQL Standard Library for C++ and to the Coding Standards library. A number of queries added in 0.6.0 included both copies of the library without appropriate namespacing, therefore causing query compilation errors. This has been resolved.
