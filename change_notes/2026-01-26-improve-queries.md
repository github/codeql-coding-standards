- `A3-1-1` - `ViolationsOfOneDefinitionRule.ql`:
  - The query previously would incorrectly allow cases where something was defined with `extern` and did not use the defined external linkage library to find external linkage. This change may result in the query finding more results. Additionally a typo has been fixed in the alert message which will cause the old alerts for this query to now show up as new ones.
- `RULE-6-0-2`, `A3-1-4` - `ExternalLinkageArrayWithoutExplicitSizeMisra.ql`, `ExternalLinkageArrayWithoutExplicitSizeAutosar.ql`:
  - The queries listed now find flexible member arrays in structs, as those do not have an explicit size.
