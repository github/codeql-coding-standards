 * `A7-1-1` - no longer report parameters as contravening this rule. This is inline with the rule intent as described in the referenced C++ Core Guidelines rule [CON.1](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#con1-by-default-make-objects-immutable), which states "To avoid confusion and lots of false positives, donâ€™t enforce this rule for function parameters."
