  - This rule no longer considers compiler-generated access to a variable when determining if the variable has a single use.
- `A8-5-3` - `AvoidAutoWithBracedInitialization.ql`:
  - Fix regression where `auto x{0}` was no longer detected as a braced initialization with type `auto` with the latest CodeQL versions.
  - No longer falsely detect cases where braced initialization was not used, but where the inferred type would be `std::initializer_list`.
- `A7-3-1` - `DefinitionNotConsideredForUnqualifiedLookup.ql`
  - The locations reported for names occurring in using-declarations has improved in the latest CodeQL versions.
- Updated the CodeQL version to `2.9.4`.
