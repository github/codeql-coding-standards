 - `M0-1-9`: This query previously excluded all results which were affected by a macro expansion. This is because a macro may be expanded multiple times with code that is dead in one expansion but live in another. This query has been modified to exclude results only where the entirety of a statement is generated by a macro. This reduces false negatives where the statements liveness is not affected by the macro expansion.
