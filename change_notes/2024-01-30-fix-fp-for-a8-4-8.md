- `A8-4-8` - `OutParametersUsed.ql`
  - Fixes #370 - Non-member user-defined assignment operator and stream insertion/extraction parameters that are required to be out parameters are excluded.
  - Broadens the definition of out parameter by considering assignment and crement operators as modifications to an out parameter candidate.
- `FIO51-CPP` - `CloseFilesWhenTheyAreNoLongerNeeded.ql`:
  - Broadened definition of `IStream` and `OStream` types may result in reduced false negatives.
- `A5-1-1` - `LiteralValueUsedOutsideTypeInit.ql`:
  - Broadened definition of `IStream` types may result in reduced false positives because more file stream function calls may be detected as logging operations that will be excluded from the results.
