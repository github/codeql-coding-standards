# CON39-C: Do not join or detach a thread that was previously joined or detached

This query implements the CERT-C rule CON39-C:

> Do not join or detach a thread that was previously joined or detached


## Description

The C Standard, 7.26.5.6 \[[ISO/IEC 9899:2011](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/AA.+Bibliography#AA.Bibliography-ISO-IEC9899-2011)\], states that a thread shall not be joined once it was previously joined or detached. Similarly, subclause 7.26.5.3 states that a thread shall not be detached once it was previously joined or detached. Violating either of these subclauses results in [undefined behavior](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/BB.+Definitions#BB.Definitions-undefinedbehavior).

## Noncompliant Code Example

This noncompliant code example detaches a thread that is later joined.

```cpp
#include <stddef.h>
#include <threads.h>
 
int thread_func(void *arg) {
  /* Do work */
  thrd_detach(thrd_current());
  return 0;
}

int main(void) {
  thrd_t t;

  if (thrd_success != thrd_create(&t, thread_func, NULL)) {
    /* Handle error */
    return 0;
  }

  if (thrd_success != thrd_join(t, 0)) {
    /* Handle error */
    return 0;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

## Compliant Solution

This compliant solution does not detach the thread. Its resources are released upon successfully joining with the main thread:

```cpp
#include <stddef.h>
#include <threads.h>
  
int thread_func(void *arg) {
  /* Do work */
  return 0;
}

int main(void) {
  thrd_t t;

  if (thrd_success != thrd_create(&t, thread_func, NULL)) {
    /* Handle error */
    return 0;
  }

  if (thrd_success != thrd_join(t, 0)) {
    /* Handle error */
    return 0;
  }
  return 0;
} 
```

## Risk Assessment

Joining or detaching a previously joined or detached thread is [undefined behavior](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/BB.+Definitions#BB.Definitions-undefinedbehavior).

## Implementation notes

This query considers problematic usages of join and detach irrespective of the execution of the program and other synchronization and interprocess communication mechanisms that may be used.
