 * subtracting incompatible pointers. Additionally, CTR53-CPP detects errors
 * using functions that operator on iterators as well as provides specific
 * models for unique cases such as `std::lexicographical_compare` via
 * `IteratorRangeModel` and `IteratorRangeFunctionCall`.
 *
 * This query covers the remaining cases of iterators used in expressions where
 * the iterator may have not been created from the same containers.
