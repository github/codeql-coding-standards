# OOP54-CPP: Gracefully handle self-copy assignment

This query implements the CERT-C++ rule OOP54-CPP:

> Gracefully handle self-copy assignment


## Description

Self-copy assignment can occur in situations of varying complexity, but essentially, all self-copy assignments entail some variation of the following.

```cpp
#include <utility>
 
struct S { /* ... */ }
 
void f() {
  S s;
  s = s; // Self-copy assignment
}
```
User-provided copy operators must properly handle self-copy assignment.

The postconditions required for copy assignment are specified by the C++ Standard, \[utility.arg.requirements\], Table 23 \[[ISO/IEC 14882-2014](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/cplusplus/AA.+Bibliography#AA.Bibliography-ISO%2FIEC14882-2014)\], which states that for `x = y`, the value of `y` is unchanged. When `&x == &y`, this postcondition translates into the values of both `x` and `y` remaining unchanged. A naive implementation of copy assignment could destroy object-local resources in the process of copying resources from the given parameter. If the given parameter is the same object as the local object, the act of destroying object-local resources will invalidate them. The subsequent copy of those resources will be left in an indeterminate state, which violates the postcondition.

A user-provided copy assignment operator must prevent self-copy assignment from leaving the object in an indeterminate state. This can be accomplished by self-assignment tests, copy-and-swap, or other idiomatic design patterns.

The C++ Standard, \[copyassignable\], specifies that types must ensure that self-copy assignment leave the object in a consistent state when passed to Standard Template Library (STL) functions. Since objects of STL types are used in contexts where `CopyAssignable` is required, STL types are required to gracefully handle self-copy assignment.

## Noncompliant Code Example

In this noncompliant code example, the copy assignment operator does not protect against self-copy assignment. If self-copy assignment occurs, `this->s1` is deleted, which results in `rhs.s1` also being deleted. The invalidated memory for `rhs.s1` is then passed into the copy constructor for `S`, which can result in dereferencing an [invalid pointer](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/cplusplus/BB.+Definitions#BB.Definitions-invalidpointer).

```cpp
#include <new>
 
struct S { S(const S &) noexcept; /* ... */ };
 
class T {
  int n;
  S *s1;
 
public:
  T(const T &rhs) : n(rhs.n), s1(rhs.s1 ? new S(*rhs.s1) : nullptr) {}
  ~T() { delete s1; }
 
  // ...
 
  T& operator=(const T &rhs) {
    n = rhs.n;
    delete s1;
    s1 = new S(*rhs.s1);
    return *this;
  }
};
```

## Compliant Solution (Self-Test)

This compliant solution guards against self-copy assignment by testing whether the given parameter is the same as `this`. If self-copy assignment occurs, then `operator=` does nothing; otherwise, the copy proceeds as in the original example.

```cpp
#include <new>
 
struct S { S(const S &) noexcept; /* ... */ };
 
class T {
  int n;
  S *s1;
 
public:
  T(const T &rhs) : n(rhs.n), s1(rhs.s1 ? new S(*rhs.s1) : nullptr) {}
  ~T() { delete s1; }

  // ...
 
  T& operator=(const T &rhs) {
    if (this != &rhs) {
      n = rhs.n;
      delete s1;
      try {
        s1 = new S(*rhs.s1);
      } catch (std::bad_alloc &) {
        s1 = nullptr; // For basic exception guarantees
        throw;
      }
    }
    return *this;
  }
};

```
This solution does not provide a [strong exception](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/cplusplus/BB.+Definitions#BB.Definitions-strongexceptionsafety) guarantee for the copy assignment. Specifically, if an exception is called when evaluating the `new` expression, `this` has already been modified. However, this solution does provide a basic exception guarantee because no resources are leaked and all data members contain valid values. Consequently, this code complies with [ERR56-CPP. Guarantee exception safety](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/cplusplus/ERR56-CPP.+Guarantee+exception+safety).

## Compliant Solution (Copy and Swap)

This compliant solution avoids self-copy assignment by constructing a temporary object from `rhs` that is then swapped with `*this`. This compliant solution provides a strong exception guarantee because `swap()` will never be called if resource allocation results in an exception being thrown while creating the temporary object.

```cpp
#include <new>
#include <utility>
 
struct S { S(const S &) noexcept; /* ... */ };
 
class T {
  int n;
  S *s1;
 
public:
  T(const T &rhs) : n(rhs.n), s1(rhs.s1 ? new S(*rhs.s1) : nullptr) {}
  ~T() { delete s1; }

  // ...
 
  void swap(T &rhs) noexcept {
    using std::swap;
    swap(n, rhs.n);
    swap(s1, rhs.s1);
  }
 
  T& operator=(T rhs) noexcept {
    rhs.swap(*this);
    return *this;
  }
};
```

## Compliant Solution (Move and Swap)

This compliant solution uses the same classes `S` and `T` from the previous compliant solution, but adds the following public constructor and methods:

```cpp
  T(T &&rhs) { *this = std::move(rhs); }

  // ... everything except operator= ..

  T& operator=(T &&rhs) noexcept {
    using std::swap;
    swap(n, rhs.n);
    swap(s1, rhs.s1);
    return *this;
  }
```
The copy assignment operator uses `std::move()` rather than `swap()` to achieve safe self-assignment and a strong exception guarantee. The move assignment operator uses a move (via the method parameter) and swap.

The move constructor is not strictly necessary, but defining a move constructor along with a move assignment operator is conventional for classes that support move operations.

Note that unlike copy assignment operators, the signature of a move assignment operator accepts a non-const reference to its object with the expectation that the moved-from object will be left in an unspecified, but valid state. Move constructors have the same difference from copy constructors.

## Risk Assessment

Allowing a copy assignment operator to corrupt an object could lead to [undefined behavior](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/cplusplus/BB.+Definitions#BB.Definitions-undefinedbehavior).

## Related Guidelines

This rule is a partial subset of [OOP58-CPP. Copy operations must not mutate the source object](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/cplusplus/OOP58-CPP.+Copy+operations+must+not+mutate+the+source+object) when copy operations do not gracefully handle self-copy assignment, because the copy operation may mutate both the source and destination objects (due to them being the same object).
