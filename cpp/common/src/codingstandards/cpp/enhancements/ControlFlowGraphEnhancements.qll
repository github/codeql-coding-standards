 * Holds if the control flow graph for `Function` `f` is likely broken due to a control flow graph

 *
 * If the extractor produces an inconsistent database where functions are only populated at call
 * sites (`funbind` relation), and not within the `functions` relation, this can cause the creation
 * of invalid control flow graphs with certain versions of the CodeQL C++ Standard Library. In
 * particular, it can cause CFGs where nodes are incorrectly inferred as unreachable.
 *
 * This has now been addressed in the CodeQL C++ Standard Library:
 *
 *   https://github.com/github/codeql/pull/5696
 *
 * But, at the time of writing, the fix is not available in the currently targeted version of the
 * CodeQL Standard Library (v1.26.0).
 *
 * This predicate determines:
 *  (a) Whether the given function is susceptible to this issue.
 *  (b) Whether the workaround appears to be in place.
 *
 * The latter ensures that if these queries are used with a new enough library, we will not exclude
 * functions unnecessarily. However, once we officially support a new enough version, this
 * workaround can and should be removed.
