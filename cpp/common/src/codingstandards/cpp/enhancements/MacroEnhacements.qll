   * A version of `MacroInvocation` that includes all potentially affected elements.
   *
   * This is a workaround for a standard library bug, where macro expansions in initializers did not
   * have any affected elements. For example, for:
   * ```
   * int x = NULL;
   * ```
   * There was a `MacroInvocation` at that location, but `getAnAffectedElement()` reported no
   * elements. This is because the class uses the `inmacroexpansion` and `macrolocationbind`
   * relations to determine "affected" elements, but the initializer only produces an entry in the
   * `affectedbymacroexpansion` relation. This class overrides the default `getAnAffectedElement()`
   * member predicate to also include elements referenced by `affectedbymacroexpansion`.
