/**
 * A module including enhancements to the standard library predicates and classes for working with
 * `AggregateLiteral`s.
 *
 * This primarily provides predicates for working with aggregate literals which are only partially
 * initialized. For example:
 * ```
 * struct Foo {
 *   int m_i1;
 *   int m_i2;
 *   struct {
 *     int m_s1_i1;
 *     int m_s1_i2;
 *   } m_s1;
 * };
 *
 * Foo f { 1, 2 }; // Missing initializer for m_s1;
 * ```
 *
 * The `AggregateLiteral` class provides a predicate `isValueInitialized` to identify those
 * elements which are not explicitly initialized. Unfortunately, it is broken in some cases,
 * incorrectly reporting that implict value initialized fields are not value initialized.
 *
 * The fundamental problem is that when the extractor sometimes populates children for implicit
 * value initialized children of aggregate literals, and sometimes does not. It appears to be that
 * it generates children if there is at least one constructor call made.
 *
 * This module worksaround this limitation by using locations to determine which children are value
 * initialized.
 *
 * In addition, it provides predicates and classes for identifying certain special kinds of
 * aggregate literal:
 *  - Implicit (where the compiler added the braces)
 *  - Partially initialized
 *  - Leading "zero" initialized
 *  - Blank initialized.
