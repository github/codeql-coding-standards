/**
 * A module to support analysis of placement new expressions in C++.
 *
 * The module provides a `PlacementNewExpr` class which identifies new expressions which use the
 * placement new operator. Access to the placement argument is provided through the member
 * predicate `getPlacementExpr`.
 *
 * The module also provides support for identifying _origins_ of the placement argument, and
 * reasoning about those origins. We use a global data flow config (`PlacementNewOriginConfig`) to
 * find origins. We consider the following possible origins:
 *
 *  1. Taking the address of an expression.
 *  2. An access of an array stack variable.
 *  3. A static cast from a pointer to a type to void *.
 *  4. A call to heap allocation function.
 *  5. An array access or pointer arithmetic expression.
 *
 * For each origin, we provide a `getMaximumMemorySize`, which identifies the maximum size of the
 * memory pointed to by the pointer (if it can be determined statically), and a `getAlignment`,
 * which provides the alignment of the pointer to memory (if it can be determined statically).
