 * invocations. This is especially hard to check and thus we adopt an
 * alternative viewpoint wherein we view a "safe" usage of multiple locks to be
 * one that uses the built in `std::lock` functionality which avoids this
 * problem.
 *
 * To properly deadlock, a thread must have at least two different locks (i.e.,
 * mutual exclusion) which are used in an order that causes a problem.  Thus we
 * look for functions with CFNs wherein there may be two locks active at the
 * same time that are invoked from a thread.
