/**
 * This module will soon be moved to a shared library outside of this project.
 *
 * Like `GraphPathSearch`, this file defines a module for efficiently finding paths in a directional
 * graph using a performant pattern called forward-reverse pruning.
 *
 * Additionally, this module is designed to track state through the paths it is looking for. For
 * instance, we could use this graph to find recursive functions, which requires knowing how an end
 * node was reached from a start node (the state).
 *
 * Like `GraphPathSearch`, this module uses forward-reverse pruning, wihch is a pattern that is
 * useful for efficiently finding connections between nodes in a directional graph. In a first pass,
 * it finds nodes reachable from the starting point. In the second pass, it finds the subset of
 * those nodes that can be reached from the end point. Together, these create a path from start
 * points to end points.
 *
 * As with the other performance patterns in qtil, this module may be useful as is, or it may not
 * fit your needs exactly. CodeQL evaluation and performance is very complex. In that case, consider
 * this pattern as an example to create your own solution that fits your needs.

/**
 * A module that implements an efficient search for a path that satisfies specified stateful
 * constraints within a custom directional graph from a set of start nodes to a set of end nodes.
 *
 * For example, this module can be used to detect loops in the graph (perhaps to find recursive
 * functions) by setting the "state" to be the start node, forwarding that state unchanged on each
 * edge, and considering a node to be an end node if it is reached with itself as the state.
 * Alternatively, the state could be used to track a maximum search depth, with a start state of
 * zero that is incremented at each edge, and where the edge relation does not hold beyond a certain
 * depth.
 *
 * To show discovered paths to users, see the module `CustomPathStateProblem` which uses this module
 * as * its underlying search implementation.
 *
 * This module uses a pattern called "forward reverse pruning" for efficiency. This pattern is
 * useful for reducing the search space when looking for paths in a directional graph. In a first
 * pass, it finds nodes reachable from the starting point. In the second pass, it finds the subset
 * of those nodes that can be reached from the end point. Together, these create a path from start
 * points to end points.
 *
 * To use this module, provide an implementation of the `GraphPathSearchSig` signature as follows:
 *
 * ```ql
 * module Config implements GraphPathSearchSig<Person> {
 *   class State extends Something { ... };
 *   predicate start(Person p, State s) { p.checkSomething() and s = p.getSomeStartValue() }
 *   predicate edge(Person p1, State s1, Person p2, State s2) { p2 = p1.getAParent() and s2 = s1.next() }
 *   predicate end(Person p, State s) { p.checkSomethingElse() and s.isValidEndState() }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The design of these predicate has a great effect in how well this performance pattern will
 * ultimately perform.
 *
 * The resulting predicate `hasPath` should be a much more efficient search of connected start nodes
 * to end nodes than a naive search (which in CodeQL could easily be evaluated as either a full
 * graph search, or a search over the cross product of all nodes).
 *
 * ```ql
 * from Person p1, State s1, Person p2, State s2
 * // Fast graph path detection thanks to forward-reverse pruning.
 * where GraphPathStateSearch<Person, Config>::hasPath(p1, s1, p2, p2)
 * select p1, s1, p2, p2
 * ```
 *
 * The resulting module also exposes two predicates:
 * - `ForwardNode`: All nodes reachable from the start nodes, with member predicate `getState()`.
 * - `ReverseNode`: All forward nodes that reach end nodes, with member predicate `getState()`.
 *
 * These classes may be useful in addition to the `hasPath` predicate.
 *
 * To track state as well as flow, use `GraphPathStateSearch` instead.
