/**
 * @id cpp/autosar/non-pod-type-should-be-defined-as-class
 * @name A11-0-1: A non-POD type should be defined as class
 * @description The class specifier forces the type to provide private access control for all its
 *              members by default. This is consistent with developer expectations, because it is
 *              expected that a class has its invariant, interface and could provide custom-defined
 *              constructors.
 * @kind problem
