/*
 * In theory this query should exclude casts using the "functional notation" syntax, e.g.
 * ```
 * int(x);
 * ```
 * This is because this is not a C-style cast, as it is not legitimate C code. However, our database
 * schema does not distinguish between C-style casts and functional casts, so we cannot exclude just
 * those.
 *
 * In addition, we do not get `CStyleCasts` in cases where the cast is converted to a `ConstructorCall`.
 * This holds for both the "functional notation" syntax and the "c-style" syntax, e.g. both of these
 * are represented in our model as `ConstructorCall`s only:
 * ```
 * class A { public: A(int); };
 * void create() {
 *   (A)1;
 *   A(1);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * As a consequence this query:
 *  - Produces false positives when primitive types are cast using the "functional notation" syntax.
 *  - Produces false negatives when a C-style cast is converted to a `ConstructorCall` e.g. when the
 *    argument type is compatible with a single-argument constructor.
